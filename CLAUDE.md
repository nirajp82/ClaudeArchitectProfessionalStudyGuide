# Study guide rules

This repo holds my study notes for the **Claude Architect Professional (CCAR-P)** exam. `ReadMe.md` at the root is the overall study plan. Each course has its own folder of lesson notes.

These rules apply to every lesson note, every time. The gold-standard example is **`01_ClaudeCode101/02-how-claude-code-works.md`**. When in doubt, copy how it does things.

## 1. When I paste a lesson: the workflow

I'll paste a lesson's **video transcript** and/or its **written course text**, sometimes with screenshots. Then:

1. **Work out the file.** Check the course folder's `README.md` progress table for the lesson number and file name. The file is `0X-lesson-name.md`, directly in the course folder.
2. **Treat the transcript as a checklist, not a draft.** It tells you *what* the lesson covers. Your job is to explain it far more clearly than the course does. Don't just tidy up the transcript.
3. **Check facts that need to be exact.** For commands, settings, keyboard shortcuts, or install steps, check the official docs (for Claude Code: `https://code.claude.com/docs`). Don't guess.
4. **Write the file** using the template in section 6.
5. **Save the images** (section 4).
6. **Update the links:**
   - In the course `README.md`, link the lesson and mark it ✅ Done.
   - In the previous lesson, check the "Next" link in **both** its header and footer.
7. **Don't commit or push** unless I ask. I commit and push myself, often. If a file changed on disk since you last read it, re-read it and build on my version.
8. **Reply briefly** (section 7).

## 2. How to write: plain English

Write for a **beginner**, as if explaining to a friend.

- **Short sentences. One idea per sentence. Everyday words.**
- **Plain idea first, course term second, in brackets:** "Claude looks around first (the course calls this *gathering context*)." Never lead with jargon.
- **Define every technical term the first time it appears:** "a **tool call** is a request from the model asking Claude Code to do something."
- **Explain *why*, not just *what*.** If the course says "auto-accept still asks before commands," also say why: an edit is easy to undo, a command may not be.
- **Numbered lists for steps. Bullets or tables for options.**
- **No marketing words or filler.**
- **Never make me guess what "it" or "this" means.** Name the thing.

## 3. How to explain: the techniques that work

Use these the way lesson 2 does. Not every lesson needs all of them; pick what makes each idea click.

| Technique | What it is | Example from lesson 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **In one sentence** | Open the lesson with the whole idea in one plain sentence. | "Claude Code works like a helper who doesn't give up after one try…" |
| **Overview table** | Before details, a table of the lesson's main parts in plain words. | "The four parts": loop, context window, tools, permissions |
| **Everyday comparison** | Compare each big idea to something from daily life. | Loop = a mechanic. Context window = a whiteboard. Tools = a friend with a wrench vs. on the phone. Permissions = keys for a new assistant. |
| **One running example** | Pick one realistic task and use it through the whole lesson. | "The login test is failing. Fix it." |
| **Concrete details** | Real file names, real file contents with line numbers, the exact command, the exact output. Show exactly what happens, not "it searches" or "it sends the result." | The `my-app` folder tree, all 16 lines of `login.js`, the exact Grep result, the exact `npm test` output |
| **Who's who table** | When more than one player is involved (you, Claude Code, your computer, the model, outside services): where each lives, what it does, an example. | Section 5, "Who's who" |
| **Step-by-step walkthrough** | For a process, one sub-section per step. In each, show what's asked, what happens, and what is sent or produced, using exact text. | Section 5, Rounds 1–5 |
| **"What goes where" table** | When data moves between places, list what moves and what stays. | "Sent to Anthropic's servers" vs. "Never left your computer" |
| **🧠 Remember this** | A one or two-line memory hook in a quote block. | "Brain on the server. Hands on your computer." |
| **Common mix-ups table** | ❌ Wrong idea vs. ✅ What really happens. | "My tests run in the cloud." → "They run on your computer." |
| **Test yourself** | 3–5 quiz questions with answers hidden in `<details>`. | Section 5, "Test yourself" |
| **Do / Why / Example table** | For practical advice. | "How to keep big tasks under control" |
| **⚠️ Warnings** | Call out real risks with a concrete example of what goes wrong. | Turning off permission questions → deleted files |

**When I ask a follow-up question about a lesson**, answer it in chat first. If I want it added, add it to the right section of that lesson, plus matching FAQ, mix-up, and test-yourself entries.

## 4. Diagrams and images

### Diagrams: always Mermaid

Draw diagrams in **Mermaid** (a ` ```mermaid ` code block), never as plain-text or box-drawing art. GitHub turns Mermaid into a real picture.

| To show… | Use | Example in lesson 2 |
|---|---|---|
| A process or loop | `flowchart TD` | — (lesson 1's agent loop) |
| Where things live and how they connect | `flowchart LR` with a `subgraph` per place | "The map": Your computer / Anthropic's servers / Tool servers |
| Who sends what to whom, step by step | `sequenceDiagram`, one column per player, with `Note over` labels for each round | "The whole conversation as a timeline" |
| How something gets filtered or narrowed down | `flowchart TD` | 1,000 files → search → 50 files → what gets sent |

- Use emoji in node labels for players: 🧑 You, 💻 Claude Code, 🗂️ Your files & terminal, ☁️ Model, 🔌 Tool servers.
- Use `<br/>` for line breaks inside nodes.
- After a diagram, add "Things to notice" bullets when the point isn't obvious.
- Keep ` ```text ` blocks **only for literal content**: folder trees, command output, the exact text of a message.

### Images: keep every course image

- Every screenshot or diagram in the course lesson should appear in the notes. They make lessons easier to understand.
- **If I paste screenshots in chat:** save them to the course's `images/` folder as `0X-short-name.png` (for example, `images/03-login-method.png`) and embed them: `![What it shows](images/03-login-method.png)`.
- **If I uploaded an image through GitHub** (a `github.com/user-attachments/...` URL), keep it exactly as is.
- **If the lesson text mentions an image I didn't paste:** leave a marker where it goes, such as `<!-- IMAGE: caption → images/03-name.png -->`, and ask me for it.

---

## 5. FAQ rules

Every lesson ends with an FAQ. Lesson 2's FAQ is the model.

- Format: `**Q1. Question?**` in bold, answer on the next line. Number them in order, with no gaps or letters (no "Q21a"). Renumber if you insert one.
- **Cover every main idea in the lesson**, plus every follow-up question I asked about it.
- Answers stand on their own: someone reading only the FAQ should understand. Plain English, short, with an example where it helps. Use a short list when an answer has several parts.
- Order the questions to follow the lesson.
- End with **2–3 `(Exam angle)` questions** that link the lesson to an exam domain, such as **Governance, Safety & Risk**. Frame them as a real scenario: "A security team asks… How do you answer?"

## 6. File layout and lesson template

### File layout

```text
<NN>_<CourseName>/             e.g. 01_ClaudeCode101/, next course 02_ClaudePlatform101/
├── README.md                  course index: progress table, links, to-dos
├── images/                    lesson images: 0X-short-name.png (the only subfolder)
├── 01-lesson-name.md          one file per lesson, numbered in course order
├── 02-lesson-name.md
└── NN-course-quiz-review.md   missed quiz questions and the correct reasoning
```

- **No chapter subfolders.** Every lesson file sits directly in the course folder.
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, numbered in course order: `05-explore-plan-code-commit.md`.
- A new course gets the same structure and a `README.md` like `01_ClaudeCode101/README.md`.

### Lesson template

Every lesson file follows this order exactly:

````markdown
# Lesson N — Lesson name

**Course:** [Course Name](course-url) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Chapter N:** Chapter name &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Completed:** Month D, YYYY

| Previous | Course | Next |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| [← Previous lesson name](0X-previous.md) | [📚 Course index](README.md) | [Next lesson name →](0X-next.md) |

---

**On this page**

| # | Section |
|:---:|:---|
| 1 | [In one sentence](#in-one-sentence) |
| 2 | [The big picture](#the-big-picture) |
| … | … |
| n | [Recap](#recap) |
| n | [My notes / practice](#my-notes--practice) |
| n | [FAQ](#faq) |

---

### In one sentence

### (Overview table of the main parts, and the running example)

---

### 1. First main idea
#### (sub-sections: comparison, steps, example, diagram, why it matters)

---

### 2. Second main idea …

---

### Recap

(One bullet per main idea, plain English.)

---

## My notes / practice

- [ ] Hands-on things to try, each one small and specific.

---

## FAQ

**Q1. …?**
Answer.

---

| Previous | Course | Next |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| (same table as the header) |
````

### Header and footer rules

- The header and footer navigation tables are **identical**.
- **Never use a `>` blockquote for the header.** GitHub joins its lines into one messy paragraph.
- First lesson: put `Start of course` in the Previous cell. Last item: put `End of course` in the Next cell.
- Main sections are `###` and get a `---` line between them. Sub-sections are `####`.

### "On this page" table rules

- List every `##` and `###` heading in page order, including Recap, My notes / practice, and FAQ. Skip `####`.
- Use bold text for "On this page", not a heading, so the table doesn't list itself.
- Build links the way GitHub does: lowercase, delete punctuation except hyphens, and turn each space into `-`.
  - `Where it's available` → `#where-its-available`
  - `My notes / practice` → `#my-notes--practice`
  - `5. Behind the scenes: your computer vs. Anthropic's servers` → `#5-behind-the-scenes-your-computer-vs-anthropics-servers`
- Update the table whenever a heading is added, renamed, or removed.

## 7. What to tell me when you're done

Keep the reply short:

1. What was created or changed, with file links.
2. **Where the video and the written course differed**, and which version you followed. Follow the written course.
3. **What you added beyond the course**: comparisons, examples, extra facts, exam-angle answers. Name them so I can check them.
4. **Missing images**: which ones to paste.
5. That nothing is committed.
