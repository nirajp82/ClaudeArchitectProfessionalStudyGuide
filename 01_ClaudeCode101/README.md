## To-do

- [ ] **Bring lessons 1 and 3 up to lesson 2's standard** (see `CLAUDE.md`). They're accurate but were written before the style rules. Each needs:
  - an "In one sentence" opener, everyday comparisons, and one running example
  - Mermaid diagrams where a flow helps
  - concrete examples (exact commands and output), "Common mix-ups" and "Test yourself"
  - an FAQ in lesson 2's style
- [ ] **Missing images.** Paste these screenshots in chat to fill the `<!-- IMAGE: ... -->` markers:
  - Lesson 2: permission prompt before a bash command → `images/02-permission-prompt.png`
  - Lesson 3: terminal after install → `images/03-terminal-install.png`
  - Lesson 3: login method selection → `images/03-login-method.png`
  - Lesson 3: VS Code extension page → `images/03-vscode-extension.png`
  - Lesson 3: JetBrains plugin page → `images/03-jetbrains-plugin.png`
  - Lesson 3: Desktop "Code" view → `images/03-desktop-code-view.png`
  - Lesson 3: claude.ai/code repo selection → `images/03-web-repo-selection.png`
  - Lesson 4: auto-accept mode working through a task → `images/04-auto-accept-mode.png`
  - Lesson 4: plan mode status bar indicator → `images/04-plan-mode-indicator.png`
  - Lesson 4: dark mode prompt typed in plan mode → `images/04-dark-mode-prompt.png`
## When you finish this course

1. [ ] Take the **course quiz**. Record every missed or guessed question, and the correct reasoning, in `13-course-quiz-review.md`.
2. [ ] Collect the **completion badge**.
3. [ ] Practice: use Claude Code to create the capstone repository structure from the [study guide (Section 5)](../ClaudeArchitectProfessionalStudyGuide.md#5-study-workspace), and review each permission prompt.
4. [ ] Mark Claude Code 101 as done in the study guide.
5. [ ] **Next course:** [Claude Platform 101](https://academy.claude.com/courses/claude-platform-101). Create a `ClaudePlatform101/` notes folder in the same format.
